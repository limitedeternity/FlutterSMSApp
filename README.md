# FlutterSMSApp

> Read-only SMS list application

## Why?

Because mobile operators in Russia offer unlimited mobile traffic and no SMS at all.
And when I was recieving an SMS I was instantly forgetting, that outgoing SMS costs money and I can reply to this message in WhatsApp or VK without additional charge.
So I created an application, that only displays incoming messages and not allows to send any message in reply by accident.
Also, I wanted to create something using Dart & Flutter, so, that's it.
